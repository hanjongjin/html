        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such 
        as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from 
        a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
        into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of 
        a web page semantically and originally included cues for 
        its appearance.</p>
